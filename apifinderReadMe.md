API, URL, and Token Finder

This Python script searches all the files in a directory (and its subdirectories) for API calls, URLs, and authorization tokens. It uses regular expressions to search for patterns that match common API call, URL, and token formats.

Usage:

1. Modify the `directory` variable to specify the directory you want to search.

2. Run the script using Python.

3. The script will print out a list of all the API calls, URLs, and tokens it finds, along with the name of the file where each match was found.

Note: This script assumes that authorization tokens are passed as strings using the "Bearer" or "Token" scheme, followed by the actual token value. If your tokens are passed in a different way (e.g. as HTTP headers), you'll need to modify the regular expression pattern to match the specific format you're using.

Dependencies:

This script requires Python 3.x and the `requests` library to be installed. You can install `requests` using pip:

    pip install requests
